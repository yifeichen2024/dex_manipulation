A comprehensive suite of GPU-accelerated environments for robot learning research and sim-to-real, built with [MuJoCo MJX](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/tree/main/mjx).

Features include:

- Classic control environments from `dm_control` reimplemented in MJX.
- Quadruped and bipedal locomotion environments.
- Non-prehensile and dexterous manipulation environments.
- Vision-based support available via [Madrona-MJX](https://github.com/shacklettbp/madrona_mjx).

For more details, check out the project [website](https://playground.mujoco.org/).

## Installation

You can install MuJoCo Playground directly from PyPI:

```sh
pip install playground
```

### From Source

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires Python 3.10 or later.

1. `git@github.com:yifeichen2024/dex_manipulation.git && cd mujoco_playground`
2. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), a faster alternative to `pip`
3. Create a virtual environment: `uv venv --python 3.11`
4. Activate it: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Install CUDA 12 jax: `uv pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"`
    * Verify GPU backend: `python -c "import jax; print(jax.default_backend())"` should print gpu
6. Install playground: `uv pip install -e ".[all]"`
7. Verify installation (and download Menagerie): `python -c "import mujoco_playground"`

#### Madrona-MJX (optional)

For vision-based environments, please refer to the installation instructions in the [Madrona-MJX](https://github.com/shacklettbp/madrona_mjx?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) repository.

## FAQ

### How can I contribute?

Get started by installing the library and exploring its features! Found a bug? Report it in the issue tracker. Interested in contributing? If you are a developer with robotics experience, we would love your help—check out the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

### Reproducibility / GPU Precision Issues
Users with NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs (e.g., RTX 30 and 40 series) may experience reproducibility [issues](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_playground/issues/86) in mujoco_playground due to JAX’s default use of TF32 for matrix multiplications. This lower precision can adversely affect RL training stability. To ensure consistent behavior with systems using full float32 precision (as on Turing GPUs), please run `export JAX_DEFAULT_MATMUL_PRECISION=highest` in your terminal before starting your experiments (or add it to the end of `~/.bashrc`).
